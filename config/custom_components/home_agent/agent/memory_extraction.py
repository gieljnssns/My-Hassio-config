"""Memory extraction functionality mixin for HomeAgent.

This module provides the MemoryExtractionMixin class that automatically extracts
and stores long-term memories from conversations. It uses LLM analysis to identify
important information worth remembering, such as user preferences, facts about the
home, and contextual information that can improve future interactions.

Architecture:
    MemoryExtractionMixin is designed as a mixin class to be inherited by HomeAgent.
    It runs asynchronously after each conversation to extract memories without
    blocking the user's response. The extraction can use either the local LLM or
    an external LLM depending on configuration.

Key Classes:
    MemoryExtractionMixin: Mixin providing automatic memory extraction with:
        - LLM-powered analysis of conversation content
        - Structured extraction of facts, preferences, context, and events
        - Quality validation to filter low-value memories
        - Integration with MemoryManager for storage
        - Support for local or external LLM extraction
        - Event emission for observability

Core Responsibilities:
    - Analyze completed conversations for memorable information
    - Build extraction prompts with conversation context
    - Call LLM (local or external) to extract structured memories
    - Parse and validate extracted memory data
    - Filter out low-quality or transient information
    - Store validated memories via MemoryManager
    - Emit events for monitoring extraction success

Memory Types:
    The system extracts four types of memories:

    1. Facts: Concrete information about home, devices, or users
       Example: "User's birthday is September 28th, 1982"

    2. Preferences: User preferences for settings and behaviors
       Example: "User prefers bedroom temperature at 68°F for sleeping"

    3. Context: Background information for future interactions
       Example: "User works night shifts and sleeps during daytime"

    4. Events: Significant actions or occurrences
       Example: "Installed new smart lock on front door on 2024-01-15"

Extraction Flow:
    1. Conversation completes in HomeAgent
    2. _extract_and_store_memories() called asynchronously (fire and forget)
    3. Build extraction prompt with conversation history
    4. Call configured LLM (local or external) with extraction prompt
    5. LLM returns JSON array of memory objects
    6. Parse JSON and validate each memory against quality rules
    7. Store validated memories via MemoryManager
    8. Emit memory_extracted event with count

Quality Validation:
    Memories are validated against multiple quality criteria:

    - Minimum length: At least 10 meaningful words (>2 chars)
    - Importance threshold: Score >= 0.4
    - No transient states: Rejects "light is on", "temperature is 72°F"
    - No conversation metadata: Rejects "we discussed X", "user asked Y"
    - No negative statements: Rejects "there is no X", "does not have Y"
    - No timestamps: Rejects temporal references to conversation time
    - No generic statements: Rejects obvious capabilities without value

    See _build_extraction_prompt() for detailed rejection criteria.

Usage Example:
    The mixin is used through inheritance in HomeAgent:

        class HomeAgent(LLMMixin, StreamingMixin, MemoryExtractionMixin):
            async def process_message(self, text, conversation_id):
                # Process conversation normally
                response = await self._process_conversation(text, ...)

                # Extract memories asynchronously (fire and forget)
                if self.config.get(CONF_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_ENABLED, True):
                    self.hass.async_create_task(
                        self._extract_and_store_memories(
                            conversation_id=conversation_id,
                            user_message=text,
                            assistant_response=response,
                            full_messages=messages
                        )
                    )

                return response

Expected Host Class Attributes:
    The mixin expects the host class to provide:

    - hass: HomeAssistant
        Home Assistant instance for async task creation and event bus

    - config: dict[str, Any]
        Configuration dictionary containing:
        - CONF_MEMORY_ENABLED: Enable memory system (default: True)
        - CONF_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_ENABLED: Enable extraction (default: True)
        - CONF_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_LLM: "local" or "external" (default: "local")
        - CONF_EXTERNAL_LLM_ENABLED: Required if extraction_llm="external"
        - CONF_EMIT_EVENTS: Enable event emission (default: True)

    - tool_handler: ToolHandler
        Tool handler for executing query_external_llm tool

    - memory_manager: Any (property)
        MemoryManager instance for storing extracted memories

    - _call_llm(): Async method (from LLMMixin)
        Used for local LLM extraction

Integration Points:
    - MemoryManager: Stores validated memories with metadata
    - LLMMixin: Provides _call_llm() for local extraction
    - ToolHandler: Executes query_external_llm for external extraction
    - Home Assistant event bus: Emits memory_extracted events

Extraction Prompt Structure:
    The extraction prompt provides the LLM with:

    - Previous conversation history (context)
    - Current conversation turn (user + assistant messages)
    - Detailed instructions on memory types
    - Quality criteria and examples
    - Rejection patterns to avoid low-value memories
    - JSON schema for structured output

External vs Local LLM:
    Local LLM (default):
        - Uses the same LLM as conversations
        - Lower latency, no additional API calls
        - May have lower quality extraction with smaller models
        - Temperature set to 0.3 for consistency

    External LLM:
        - Uses specialized external LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
        - Higher quality extraction with larger models
        - Additional API costs and latency
        - Requires CONF_EXTERNAL_LLM_ENABLED: true

Memory Storage Format:
    Each memory is stored with:
        {
            "content": "User prefers bedroom at 68°F for sleeping",
            "type": "preference",  // fact, preference, context, event
            "importance": 0.8,  // 0.0 to 1.0
            "conversation_id": "conv_123",
            "metadata": {
                "entities_involved": ["climate.bedroom"],
                "topics": ["temperature", "bedroom", "sleep"],
                "extraction_method": "automatic"
            }
        }

Events:
    Emits memory_extracted event when successful:
        {
            "conversation_id": "conv_123",
            "memories_extracted": 3,
            "extraction_llm": "local",
            "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
        }

Configuration Example:
    # Use local LLM for extraction
    config = {
        CONF_MEMORY_ENABLED: True,
        CONF_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_ENABLED: True,
        CONF_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_LLM: "local",
        CONF_EMIT_EVENTS: True
    }

    # Use external LLM for better quality
    config = {
        CONF_MEMORY_ENABLED: True,
        CONF_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_ENABLED: True,
        CONF_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_LLM: "external",
        CONF_EXTERNAL_LLM_ENABLED: True,
        CONF_EMIT_EVENTS: True
    }

Error Handling:
    - Extraction failures are logged but never block conversation responses
    - Invalid JSON responses are caught and logged
    - Individual memory storage failures don't stop other memories
    - Missing MemoryManager gracefully skips extraction

2. **Preferences**: User preferences for temperature, lighting, routines, etc.
3. **Context**: Background information useful for future interactions
4. **Events**: Significant events or actions that occurred

## Previous Conversation

{conversation_text if conversation_text else "(No previous conversation)"}

## Current Turn

User: {user_message}
Assistant: {assistant_response}

## Instructions

Extract memories as a JSON array. Each memory should have:
- "type": One of "fact", "preference", "context", "event"
- "content": Clear, concise description (1-2 sentences)
- "importance": Score from 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0 = very important)
- "entities": List of Home Assistant entity IDs mentioned (if any)
- "topics": List of topic tags (e.g., ["temperature", "bedroom"])

**Importance Score Guidelines:**
- 0.9-1.0: Critical personal info (birthdays, allergies, security codes, medical needs)
- 0.7-0.8: Strong preferences with specific values (temperature 68°F, lights at 50%)
- 0.5-0.6: General preferences and useful context (prefers dim lights, works from home)
- 0.3-0.4: Minor details mentioned in passing (asked about a feature once)
- 0.1-0.2: Trivial or uncertain information (might want something someday)

**Critical Rules:**
- Only extract genuinely useful, long-term information
- Each memory must be at least 7 words long
- Be specific and concrete with actionable details
- If nothing worth remembering, return empty array: []

**NEVER extract (these will be automatically rejected):**
- ❌ Current device states: "light is on", "temperature is 72°F",
  "door is closed", "lights are currently on"
- ❌ Transient states: "is currently", "are now", "was on", "were off", "right now", "at the moment"
- ❌ Current time/clock: "the current time is 10:30 PM", "it is currently 8 AM", "the time is"
- ❌ Current weather: "weather is sunny", "it's raining",
  "forecast shows rain", "temperature outside is 65°F"
- ❌ Current date/day: "today is Monday", "this week", "this month", "it's Tuesday"
- ❌ Current location/presence: "user is home", "user is away", "just arrived", "nobody is home"
- ❌ Conversation meta-data: "conversation occurred at 3pm", "we discussed X", "user asked about Y"
- ❌ Negative statements: "there is no X", "no specific Y sensor", "does not have Z"
- ❌ Timestamps of conversation: "at 8:59 PM on November 4", "during the conversation"
- ❌ Generic statements: "the lights can be controlled", "temperature can be adjusted"
- ❌ Questions without answers: "user asked about temperature" (unless you provide the answer)
- ❌ Very brief statements under 7 words

**ALWAYS extract (these are valuable):**
- ✅ User preferences with values: "user prefers bedroom temperature at 68°F for sleeping"
- ✅ Permanent facts: "user's birthday is March 15th", "kitchen has 3 ceiling lights"
- ✅ Patterns and routines: "user wants kitchen lights at 50% brightness during daytime"
- ✅ Device capabilities (not states): "bedroom thermostat supports heating and cooling modes"
- ✅ Important context: "user works night shifts and sleeps during the day"
- ✅ Scheduled events: "user has a dentist appointment on January 15th at 2pm"

**Examples of REJECTED memories:**
- "The kitchen lights are currently on" → REJECT: transient device state
- "Conversation occurred at 20:59 PM" → REJECT: conversation metadata
- "There is no bed sensor in the guest room" → REJECT: negative statement
- "User asked about lights" → REJECT: question without answer, too brief
- "The current time is 10:29 PM" → REJECT: current time (changes constantly)
- "It's raining outside" → REJECT: current weather (ephemeral)
- "User is currently at home" → REJECT: current presence state
- "Today is Wednesday" → REJECT: current date (changes daily)

**Examples of GOOD memories:**
- "User prefers kitchen lights at 50% brightness during daytime hours" → GOOD: preference with value
- "User's birthday is March 15th" → GOOD: permanent fact
- "User works night shifts Mon-Fri and sleeps during daytime"
  → GOOD: important routine
- "User's anniversary is on June 20th" → GOOD: permanent date fact

Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text:
