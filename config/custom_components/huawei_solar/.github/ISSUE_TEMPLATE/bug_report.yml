      ## Relevant debug logs
      
      **You MUST include relevant logfiles to debug your issue.**
      
      The easiest way to provide debug logs is by using the `Enable/Disable debug logging` feature as described here: ['Debug Logs and Diagnostics' from the HA documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics)

      ![Enable Debug Logging menu entry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wlcrs/huawei_solar/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/images/enable-debug-logging.png)

      If you are having problems during initial setup of this integration, you'll need to manually gather these logs. To do this, add the following lines to your `/config/configuration.yaml` and restart HA:

      ```yaml
      logger:
        default: debug
        logs:
          custom_components.huawei_solar: debug
          huawei_solar: debug
          pymodbus: debug # only include this if you're having connectivity issues
      ```
      
      Make sure to check for relevant log lines in the **Full logs**, which you can also find in `/config/home-assistant.log`. Do NOT copy&paste info from the summary that you see when going to `System â†’ Logs`, always push the "Load Full Logs" button and look there.
