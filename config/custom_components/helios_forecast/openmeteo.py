"""Open-Meteo client.

Thin transport, matching the card's own weather request so the forecast is fed
the same data on ``/v1/forecast``. Hourly cloud layers
(``cloud_cover_low/mid/high``, fused into one weighted cover),
``shortwave_radiation_instant``, ``direct_radiation_instant``,
``diffuse_radiation_instant``, ``temperature_2m``, ``wind_speed_10m``,
``snow_depth``. Values are the per-hour median across
``pick_models_for_location`` (a regional high-resolution model paired with a
global one), the same selection the card uses. A second, best-effort call over a
wider model ensemble adds only the cross-model cloud spread, a
forecast-uncertainty signal.

No unit parameters are sent, so Open-Meteo returns its defaults (W/m2 for
irradiance, degC, snow depth in metres). URL construction and parsing are pure
functions, testable without a network or aiohttp; the async fetchers take a
caller-provided session (HA's shared aiohttp client).
