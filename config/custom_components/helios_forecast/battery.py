"""Battery state-of-charge projection.

Walks the PV forecast against the learned consumption profile over the coming hours and
integrates the battery's charge. The default arbitration is the universal one: surplus
(PV above the house load) charges the battery, a deficit discharges it to cover the house,
each bounded by the configured charge / discharge power and the usable capacity. Round-trip
losses are split evenly across the two sides.

It does not model a vendor's own charge schedule (time-of-use force-charging and the like):
those are invisible from the outside, so the projection assumes the battery follows the
house. It carries no charge command either, only the predicted curve. Pure functions, no
Home Assistant.
