"""The Helios Solar Forecast integration.

Computes a PV production forecast server-side from Open-Meteo irradiance and the
installation geometry, and publishes it three ways: a first-class entity set for
automations, the Energy dashboard's solar-forecast provider, and a websocket
detail series for the Helios card. A learned residual, built from the recorder's
own production history, corrects the model against the site's real output.

Home Assistant imports stay inside the setup / unload functions so importing this
package needs no running Home Assistant: the pure forecast model under it can be
imported and unit-tested on its own.
