"""Today's forecast trend.

How much today's predicted total energy has moved since a fixed daily reference,
the snapshot taken at a set local hour (default 06:00, when the day's outlook is
settled enough to act on). Positive means the day now looks better than at the
reference, negative means worse, and the magnitude is the kWh swing. The reference
is captured once per day and frozen; the trend is recomputed against it every
refresh, so a user with panels + battery can see, mid-day, whether the outlook is
improving or degrading versus this morning.

Pure functions, no Home Assistant; the coordinator owns the persistence.
