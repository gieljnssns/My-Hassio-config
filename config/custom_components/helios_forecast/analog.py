"""Analog-ensemble forecast refinement.

Instead of trusting a generic physical model, look up past hours whose conditions
(sun geometry + cloud cover) resemble the hour being forecast, and read the
distribution of what the installation ACTUALLY produced then. The median is a
site-calibrated point forecast (it already contains the real shading, soiling,
orientation error and inverter behaviour), and the 10th/90th percentiles are a
free, data-driven uncertainty band.

This refines the physical model rather than replacing it: when few close analogs
exist (cold start, unusual conditions) the prediction blends back toward the
physical value by confidence, so the forecast degrades gracefully.

Pure functions, no Home Assistant. Production buckets are duck-typed
(``.start_ms`` + ``.end_ms`` + ``.kwh``); the only dependency is the sun geometry.
