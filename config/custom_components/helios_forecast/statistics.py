"""Pure helpers for archiving the Open-Meteo weather to HA statistics.

The 7 weather variables here are orientation-independent: they describe the sky
over the home, not the panels, so this archive stays valid across any PV layout
change. Plane-of-array irradiance is deliberately not archived: it depends on
orientation and is recomputed from the direct / diffuse / global irradiance kept
here plus the sun geometry (see solar/irradiance.py).

Open-Meteo only serves a rolling 60-day past window. By copying each refresh's
past hours into Home Assistant's long-term statistics (which are never purged),
the history grows without bound and stays consultable well beyond those 60 days.

No Home Assistant imports, so the transforms can be unit-tested on their own.
