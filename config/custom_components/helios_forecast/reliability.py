"""Forecast reliability index.

A 0..100 confidence score blending three measurable signals:

  - data maturity: how many days of production history back the learning (a fresh
    install corrects nothing; ~60 days is fully warmed up).
  - recent skill: how close the model's predicted daily energy has been to the
    real production over the last couple of weeks (the honest empirical signal).
  - today's predictability: a clear or steadily overcast sky is highly
    predictable; broken, variable cloud is intrinsically uncertain whatever the
    data, so we read the spread of today's daytime cloud forecast.

Pure functions, no Home Assistant, so the blend can be unit-tested on its own.
The inputs are duck-typed: production buckets expose ``.start_ms`` + ``.kwh``,
forecast points expose ``.t`` (UTC datetime) + ``.pv_w``.
