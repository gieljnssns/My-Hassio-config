"""Headless cycle-replay 'Playground' backend (Group F3).

Pure, executor-safe logic behind the panel's Playground tab. Nothing here
touches Home Assistant, fires events, or does I/O; the WebSocket handlers in
``ws_api.py`` call these helpers inside ``hass.async_add_executor_job``.

Main entry points:

- :func:`simulate_cycle_detail` - faithful single-cycle replay with per-step
  progress/remaining-time/phase/energy series and typed event log.
- :func:`run_playground_history` - per-cycle rows + optional before/after diff.
- :func:`run_playground_sweep` - objective 1D/2D grid sweep.
- :func:`dtw_debug_payload` - the score breakdown (Stage 2 / DTW / Stage 4),
  the two resampled traces on a shared grid, and the DTW warping path for one
  cycle vs one profile (the DTW visualizer).

All top-level entry points are defensive: they never raise, returning an
``{"error": ...}`` marker instead so the WS handlers can relay it.
