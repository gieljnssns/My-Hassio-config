"""On-device tuning of the matcher's scoring weights (Stage 4/5, opt-in).

Mirrors the offline ``devtools/dtw_ab_eval.py`` methodology but as a shippable,
NumPy-only, executor-safe pure function: it does leave-one-out matching over the
device's own labelled cycles, sweeps a small grid of the highest-impact scoring
weights (corr/MAE split, duration agreement weight, energy agreement weight, and
DTW ensemble weight independently), and - only if a candidate beats the shipped
defaults on a HELD-OUT split by a margin - returns a per-device config override. The caller persists it; the matcher reads it live
and falls back to the const defaults otherwise.

Discipline (same as model promotion): tune on a train split, gate on a held-out
split, require a margin, cap the grid to bounded scoring weights (never
structural behaviour). This guards against over-fitting the small, partly
manually-labelled per-user cycle set.

         built from all cycles — as in production, where a query is matched
         against aggregates of the full profile library; only the *query* targets
         are partitioned.)
      3. **Gate** the fixed candidate on the HOLDOUT pool: it must beat the
         shipped defaults by at least ``margin`` on a MAJORITY of reshuffled
         holdout subsamples (a variance check that rejects a lucky single split)

         per-device tuning becomes useful early; the majority gate — not a large
         sample — controls the noise.

    Returns a status dict; ``promoted`` is True only when both holdout gates pass.
    When promoted, ``config`` holds the override to persist (bounded scoring
    weights only — never structural matching behaviour). Never raises for data
