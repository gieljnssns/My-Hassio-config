# Standby-band stuck-in-RUNNING finalize (#296).  Some appliances finish but hold

# (e.g. a ~2.5-3.2 W baseline while stop_threshold is ~1.2 W).  Because power never
# drops below the stop threshold, _time_below_threshold never accumulates, so the
# cycle never reaches PAUSED/ENDING and runs until the 8 h RUNNING cap — and the
# anti-wrinkle handler can't help because entering it requires a completed
# TIMEOUT/SMART finish that never happens (chicken-and-egg).  This detector spots a
# sustained, FLAT, tiny-fraction-of-peak plateau *past* the expected duration and
# finalizes the cycle (as a normal TIMEOUT completion, so an anti-wrinkle-enabled
# washer/dryer still routes into ANTI_WRINKLE afterwards).  Heavily gated so it can
# never end an active low-power phase: it needs a matched profile, elapsed >= 2x

# After a wash finishes, some machines (e.g. Miele) hold a low-power tumble tail -
# a constant baseline plus periodic sub-``anti_wrinkle_max_power`` bursts, NO
# heating - until the door is opened.  To the power-off detector this looks like
# continued RUNNING (the bursts recur faster than off_delay and keep reviving the
# cycle out of ENDING), so the cycle never finalises into STATE_ANTI_WRINKLE - the
# state that is designed to absorb the tail and split off the next wash.  If a
# second load is started before the door is opened, the whole sequence
# (wash -> tail -> wash -> tail) merges into one multi-hour "cycle".
#
# Two coordinated mechanisms fix it, BOTH opt-in via ``anti_wrinkle_enabled`` and
# gated to the anti-wrinkle device types (see ``anti_wrinkle_active`` in
# cycle_detector):
#
#  * a proactive finalise (``_is_anticrease_tail`` -> Smart Termination into
#    ANTI_WRINKLE): once a *matched* cycle is past its expected duration AND the
#    recent window shows only the low-power tail, finalise without waiting to reach
#    ENDING through the burst-defeated off_delay path;
#  * a match freeze (``_try_profile_match`` guard) under the SAME condition, so
#    re-matching on the growing flat tail cannot drift the label to a longer
#    near-duplicate profile (which would push expected_duration out and break the
#    finalise gate) - the field failure that breaks Smart Termination.
#
# Gated on ``elapsed >= expected * ratio`` so a legitimate mid-wash low-power phase
# can NEVER trigger it: a washer spends most of its cycle below
# ``anti_wrinkle_max_power`` (only brief heating spikes exceed it), but every
# observed clean cycle's mid-cycle sub-max_power gap ENDS well before its expected
# duration, while the anti-crease tail BEGINS after it.  Also requires a genuinely
# energetic cycle (peak above ``anti_wrinkle_max_power``) so a low-power program
# that never heats is left alone.  Asymmetric (finalise-only, can only shorten the
# wait) and self-correcting (a new wash's heating burst leaves the regime and

# Issue #43: dishwasher end-of-cycle pump-out handling.
#
# A dishwasher's wash→drying drain wind-down produces brief power spikes mid
# ENDING that, prior to the issue #43 fix, would set _end_spike_seen=True and
# pre-arm Smart Termination - so the cycle closed at 99% of expected, BEFORE
# the real end-of-cycle pump-out at ~99.5% of expected.  The pump-out then
# registered as a brand-new cycle.
#
# Two coordinated thresholds gate the fix.  They MUST agree: the wait window
# in _should_defer_finish (DISHWASHER_END_SPIKE_WAIT_SECONDS) is the upper
# bound for keeping the cycle open without an end spike, and Smart
# Termination's own wait branch in STATE_ENDING uses the SAME constant so the
# two paths release the cycle at the same moment.
#
# A spike at < DISHWASHER_END_SPIKE_MIN_PROGRESS of expected duration is

# existing long_ending_tail path - this only governs the smart-termination
# pre-arming).

# Widened from 300s to 1800s after issue #43 follow-up:

# duration-agreement score toward LONGER near-duplicate profiles, which would 
# flip the stored label and stall smart-termination on the ambiguity gate.  
# The active-phase match is complete
# by now, so freezing it preserves the correct program identity.  A real

# armed - finalise near its expected end instead of hanging the full
# DISHWASHER_END_SPIKE_WAIT_SECONDS (30 min) past expected.  Gated on reaching the
# expected duration so a long passive-drying phase that still precedes a genuinely-late
# pump-out (quiet from ~50%-99% of expected) keeps waiting and its real pump-out is
# caught by the end-spike arm first.  Smaller than the 30-min window but large enough
# to confirm a terminal tail rather than an inter-phase gap.

# drying "pause" so a single cycle is not split by the fallback timeout, but that
# large value must NOT delay Smart Termination - which ends the cycle near the
# matched profile's expected duration so the finish notification is timely.  A
# previous formula (max(300, off_delay*0.25)) coupled the two: a suggested
# off_delay of 1800-1999 s inflated this window to 450-500 s, and on the sparsely
# sampled near-zero drying tail the eligibility instant could fall in a gap
# between samples, slipping the cycle's end by 20+ min or leaving it to only end
# via the fallback timeout (which snaps the trace back and drops the drying tail)
# or a manual stop.  300 s (the old floor, proven on a hand-tuned production
