# Issue #43: dishwasher end-of-cycle pump-out handling.
#
# A dishwasher's wash→drying drain wind-down produces brief power spikes mid
# ENDING that, prior to the issue #43 fix, would set _end_spike_seen=True and
# pre-arm Smart Termination — so the cycle closed at 99% of expected, BEFORE
# the real end-of-cycle pump-out at ~99.5% of expected.  The pump-out then
# registered as a brand-new cycle.
#
# Two coordinated thresholds gate the fix.  They MUST agree: the wait window
# in _should_defer_finish (DISHWASHER_END_SPIKE_WAIT_SECONDS) is the upper
# bound for keeping the cycle open without an end spike, and Smart
# Termination's own wait branch in STATE_ENDING uses the SAME constant so the
# two paths release the cycle at the same moment.
#
# A spike at < DISHWASHER_END_SPIKE_MIN_PROGRESS of expected duration is
# ignored for end-spike tracking (the cycle still stays in ENDING via the
# existing long_ending_tail path - this only governs the smart-termination
# pre-arming).
