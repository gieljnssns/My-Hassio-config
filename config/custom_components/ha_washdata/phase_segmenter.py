"""Unsupervised power-trace phase segmentation (Phase 0 prototype).

Turns a cycle's power trace into an ordered list of :class:`PhaseSegment`
(role, start/end offset, duration, energy, mean/peak power) via a hysteresis
regime classifier (idle / active / high) + minimum-run merge + role assignment
driven by a per-device-type :class:`PhaseModel`.

Constraint: NumPy only, no Home Assistant imports. Pure and executor-safe;
``segment_cycle`` never raises - it returns ``[]`` on malformed input.

Consumed live (behind the default-off ``enable_phase_matching`` per-device gate)
by `profile_store.ProfileStore` (phase-profile cache + `phase_remaining`) and,
offline, by the side-by-side harness (`devtools/eta_phase_eval.py`). See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-phase-segmented-matching-design.md`.
