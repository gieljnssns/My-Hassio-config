       the real stored value is ``"recorder"`` — the migration runs against the
       real store, not the export.)

    2. **Structural signature** (old recordings, ``meta`` is ``None``): the
       recorder builds the cycle dict directly (``ws_process_recording``) and
       never sets ``max_power`` or ``termination_reason``, whereas *every*

       ``max_power``). So a **completed** cycle missing *both* fields is a

        Parameters:
            cycle_ids (list[str]): Unordered set of past-cycle IDs to merge; at least two IDs are required.
                The function internally sorts cycles by start_time and mutates the chronologically earliest cycle.
            target_profile (str | None): Profile name to assign to the merged cycle, or `None` to leave unlabeled.

        Description:
            When successful, this sorts the provided cycles by start_time and replaces the earliest cycle with the merged cycle,
            removing the other consumed cycles and updating related metadata.
        
            Side effects:
            - Updates the store's past_cycles (removes consumed cycles and replaces the first cycle with the merged record).
            - Clears any `manual_duration` override on the resulting cycle.
            - Updates `sample_cycle_id` references in profiles that pointed to removed cycles.
            - Attempts to recompute and store the merged cycle's signature.
            - Persists changes to storage and triggers envelope rebuilds for affected profiles.
