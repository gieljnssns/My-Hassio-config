    Recursively walks each foundry config and, for any string value that begins
    with ``!``, re-parses it as a YAML fragment via
    :func:`homeassistant.util.yaml.parse_yaml`.  This delegates resolution to
    annotatedyaml's native constructors, giving full support for:

    - ``!include <path>`` — loads a YAML file relative to the HA config
      directory; nested ``!include`` and ``!secret`` inside that file are also
      resolved automatically.
    - ``!secret <name>`` — resolves the named secret from ``secrets.yaml``.
    - ``!include_dir_list``, ``!include_dir_named``, ``!env_var``, etc.

    String values that do not begin with ``!`` are left unchanged.

    This function performs file I/O and must be called from an executor thread
    (e.g. via :meth:`~homeassistant.core.HomeAssistant.async_add_executor_job`).
