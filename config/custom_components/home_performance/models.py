"""Thermal loss coefficient model for Home Performance.

This module implements a simple, physics-based approach to calculate
the thermal loss coefficient K (W/°C) of a room.

Formula: K = Energy / (ΔT × duration)

Where:
- Energy = heater_power × heating_time (in Wh)
- ΔT = average temperature difference (indoor - outdoor)
- duration = observation period (in hours)

Example: 1000W heater running 6h/24h to maintain 19°C when it's 5°C outside:
- Energy = 1000W × 6h = 6000 Wh
- ΔT = 14°C
- K = 6000 / (14 × 24) ≈ 18 W/°C

This room loses 18W per degree of temperature difference with outside.
